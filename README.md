## SueQL
After taking a database class, I want to try implement a database in Rust.
Also thanks [Nick](https://github.com/schainic) for the name idea.

### Current Progress
 - [X] BufMgr, a pager to cache pages from disk
 - [X] Create table, insert, and select * working with current provided data types (char, int, varchar)
