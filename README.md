## SueQL
After taking a database class, I want to try implement a database in Rust.
Also thanks [Nick](https://github.com/schainic) for the name idea.

### Current Progress
There's nothing in right now.

~~I'm implementing external sort for the database.~~
I realized that I kinda need to write the storage for the database first while implementing external sort
