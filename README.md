## SueQL
After taking a database class, I want to try implement a database in Rust.
Also thanks [Nick](https://github.com/schainic) for the name idea.

### Current Progress
 - [X] Storage structs to help the database operate on pages
 - [X] External sort for fun
 - [X] Database and table structs/storage (only the info of db and table, not the data)
 - [ ] SQL parser
 - [ ] Query plan
