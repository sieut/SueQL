## SueQL
After taking a database class, I want to try implement a database in Rust.
Also thanks [Nick](https://github.com/schainic) for the name idea.

### Current Progress
There's nothing in right now.

 - [X] Storage structs to help the database operate on pages
 - [X] External sort for fun
 - [ ] Database and table structs/storage
